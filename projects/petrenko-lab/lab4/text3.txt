Love is the best feeling in the world. Love makes the world go round. It is the greatest mystery of all times. If you ask someone "What is love?", he or she will hardly find enough words to express its meaning. Love can be different. There is love for parents, love for children, love for animals, love for friends, first love, love for husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend. When you love someone or something, your heart and soul become warmer and kinder. People, who carry love in their hearts, are always happy and in good mood.
Love helps to live and survive in the hardest moments of our lives. Almost all feelings in the world have some advantages or disadvantages. However, love has only advantages. It brings harmony and peace. The only type of love that can be painful is unrequited love. It's when you love someone, but he or she doesn't feel the same about you. It's sad but it often happens. Moreover, I think that all people have experienced one-sided love at least once in their life. Again, I don't think it's a disadvantage of love. One-sided love teaches us something new, enriches with life experience and makes us stronger. Some wise men even say that one-sided love is better than none. Another disadvantage of love is its role in wars. Many ancient wars started because of love to a woman. Still, I think that love is the most important thing in everyone's life. That's why poets make verses, directors shoot films and composers write songs about it.
All people in the world want to love and to be loved. When love is mutual, it is the best thing that can ever happen to a man.
